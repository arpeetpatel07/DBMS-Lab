Experiment No. 5 

Aim:  To study and execute different joins in SQL.

Solution:
We’ll create sample tables for practice first then understand the working of joins in SQL.
Tables Required
1.	Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary, manager_id)
2.	Departments (dept_id, dept_name, location)
3.	Projects (proj_id, proj_name, dept_id)
4.	Assignments (emp_id, proj_id, hours_worked)
• Employees Table: Contains employee details including department and manager relationships.
• Departments Table: Contains department information and locations.
• Projects Table: Contains project details linked to departments.
• Assignments Table: Links employees to projects and tracks hours worked.

Create Tables
Employees Table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    manager_id INT
);

Departments Table
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50),
    location VARCHAR(50)
);

Projects Table
CREATE TABLE Projects (
    proj_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    proj_name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT
);



Assignments Table
CREATE TABLE Assignments (
    emp_id INT,
    proj_id INT,
    hours_worked INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (emp_id, proj_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES Employees(emp_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (proj_id) REFERENCES Projects(proj_id)
);

Populate Tables with Sample Data

Employees Table Data
INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary, manager_id) VALUES
(1, 'John', 101, 5000.00, NULL),
(2, 'Alice', 102, 3000.00, 1),
(3, 'Robert', 101, 4000.00, 1),
(4, 'Michael', 103, 7000.00, NULL),
(5, 'Susan', 102, 3500.00, 2),
(6, 'Nancy', 104, 4200.00, NULL),
(7, 'David', 103, 3900.00, 4),
(8, 'Laura', 101, 5200.00, 3);

Departments Table Data
INSERT INTO Departments (dept_id, dept_name, location) VALUES
(101, 'Finance', 'New York'),
(102, 'HR', 'Chicago'),
(103, 'IT', 'Dallas'),
(104, 'Marketing', 'San Francisco');

Projects Table Data
INSERT INTO Projects (proj_id, proj_name, dept_id) VALUES
(201, 'Project A', 101),
(202, 'Project B', 103),
(203, 'Project C', 102),
(204, 'Project D', 104);

Assignments Table Data
INSERT INTO Assignments (emp_id, proj_id, hours_worked) VALUES
(1, 201, 30),
(2, 203, 40),
(3, 201, 20),
(4, 202, 50),
(5, 203, 35),
(6, 204, 25),
(7, 202, 45);


Exercises:

1. INNER JOIN
    Objective: Retrieve and display the list of employees along with their department names.
    
   SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name 
    FROM Employees e 
    INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;


2. LEFT JOIN
    Objective: Display all employees and their assigned projects, including employees who are not assigned to any project.
   
    SELECT e.emp_name, p.proj_name 
    FROM Employees e 
    LEFT JOIN Assignments a ON e.emp_id = a.emp_id
    LEFT JOIN Projects p ON a.proj_id = p.proj_id;


3. RIGHT JOIN
    Objective: List all projects and the employees assigned to them, including projects with no employees.

    SELECT p.proj_name, e.emp_name 
    FROM Projects p 
    RIGHT JOIN Assignments a ON p.proj_id = a.proj_id
    RIGHT JOIN Employees e ON a.emp_id = e.emp_id;


4. FULL OUTER JOIN
    Objective: Get a list of all employees and departments, showing departments without employees and employees without departments.
    
    SELECT e.emp_name, d.dept_name 
    FROM Employees e 
    FULL OUTER JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;


5. SELF JOIN
    Objective: Display the list of employees along with their managers' names.
    
    SELECT e.emp_name AS Employee, m.emp_name AS Manager 
    FROM Employees e 
    LEFT JOIN Employees m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;
6. CROSS JOIN
    Objective: Generate a report showing all possible pairs of employees and projects (regardless of assignment).
    
SELECT e.emp_name, p.proj_name 
FROM Employees e 
CROSS JOIN Projects p;


Outcome:
1.	Understanding how INNER JOIN retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
2.	Learn how LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table, with NULL for non-matching rows.
3.	Understand RIGHT JOIN and its use in retrieving all records from the right table with NULL for non-matching rows on the left.
4.	Learn to use FULL OUTER JOIN to return all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
5.	Understand how to use SELF JOIN to relate rows within the same table, useful for hierarchical data.
6.	Learn the use of CROSS JOIN to create a Cartesian product, combining all rows from two tables.
