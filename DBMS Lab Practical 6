Experiment No. 6

Aim:  To study PL/SQL Procedure and write procedures for:
i.	Swapping of two numbers without using third variable,
ii.	Largest amongst three numbers.
iii.	Area of circle by radius as an argument.

Solution:

1. Swapping Two Numbers Without Using a Third Variable Procedure Creation:

Create the Stored Procedure
Create the stored procedure by entering the PL/SQL code directly in the SQLPlus CLI.

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SwapNumbers (
    num1 IN OUT NUMBER,
    num2 IN OUT NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
    num1 := num1 + num2;
    num2 := num1 - num2;
    num1 := num1 - num2;
END;
/
**Note: Ensure you include the / after the END; to execute the procedure creation.

Call the Stored Procedure
Call the stored procedure in an anonymous PL/SQL block from the CLI

DECLARE
    a NUMBER := 10;
    b NUMBER := 20;
BEGIN
    SwapNumbers(a, b);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Swap: a = ' || a || ', b = ' || b);
END;
/

Enable Output in SQLPlus, before you can see the output of DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE, you need to enable the server output in SQLPlus
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON

Call the procedure directly in SQLPlus or a similar tool:

EXEC SwapNumbers(10, 20);


Explanation:
•	The procedure is called within an anonymous PL/SQL block.
•	The variables a and b are passed as IN OUT parameters, meaning their values are modified by the procedure.
•	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE is used to print the output.



2. Finding the Largest Amongst Three Numbers Procedure Creation:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE FindLargest (
    num1 IN NUMBER,
    num2 IN NUMBER,
    num3 IN NUMBER,
    largest OUT NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
    IF num1 >= num2 AND num1 >= num3 THEN
        largest := num1;
    ELSIF num2 >= num1 AND num2 >= num3 THEN
        largest := num2;
    ELSE
        largest := num3;
    END IF;
END;
/

Execution Example:
DECLARE
    x NUMBER := 15;
    y NUMBER := 25;
    z NUMBER := 10;
    maxVal NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FindLargest(x, y, z, maxVal);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Largest Value: ' || maxVal);
END;
/



Explanation:
•	maxVal is used as an OUT parameter to receive the largest number.
•	The procedure is called, and the result is displayed using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.
 


3. Calculating the Area of a Circle Given the Radius Procedure Creation:
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CalculateArea (
    radius IN NUMBER,
    area OUT NUMBER
) AS
BEGIN
    area := 3.14159 * radius * radius;
END;
/

Execution Example:
DECLARE
    r NUMBER := 5;
    areaCircle NUMBER;
BEGIN
    CalculateArea(r, areaCircle);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Area of Circle: ' || areaCircle);
END;
/

Explanation:
•	The radius (r) is passed to the procedure, and the calculated area is returned in areaCircle.
•	The procedure is called, and the area of the circle is printed.

Outcome:

    Procedure Creation Queries: These queries define the PL/SQL procedures (SwapNumbers, FindLargest, and CalculateArea) that perform the required operations.

    Execution Queries: These anonymous PL/SQL blocks demonstrate how to call each procedure, passing in appropriate values and printing the results using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.
